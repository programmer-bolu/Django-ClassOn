            <p class="h2">History</p>
            <p>ClassGr began with a vision to revolutionize the way students and educators manage and interact with class schedules.
            Recognizing the challenges that both students and educators face in organizing and keeping track of their academic
            commitments, the journey to create ClassGr was set in motion.
            
            In the early days, the focus was on understanding the core needs of the educational community. Through extensive
            research and feedback from students, teachers, and administrators, a clear picture emerged: there was a significant gap
            in the market for a user-friendly, efficient, and comprehensive scheduling tool. With this insight, the first version of
            ClassGr was developed, aiming to provide a seamless experience for all users.
